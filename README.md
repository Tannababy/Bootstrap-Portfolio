# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

In this week's challenge :star_struck:, we were given the task to create a live (deployed) portfolio page containing projects we've worked on and space for future projects to be added, using Bootstrap.

Below is a screenshot of the website.

## Usage

This portfolio project's purpose is to display some of my skills as a developer, in a way that is visually pleasing and easier for clients and visitors to navigate around.
